		<h1>Work</h1>
		<ul id="works_list">
			<li><a href="https://amimappy.github.io/class-link-check">Class Link Check - [Defunct and Not Maintained]</a> - Chrome extension that checked for google meet links on google classroom pages and alerted students.<br>I am solely a maintainer of the <a href="https://github.com/AmiMappy/class-link-check">project</a> now.</li>			
			<li><a href="https://top.gg/bot/908025685610758214">Discord Matchbot - [Defunct and Not Maintained]</a> - A silly little discord bot that lets you maintain a list of crushes and check periodically if it is mutual(howeversilly this might be, it has helped me learn quite a bit about discord bot making and working with firebase).</li>
			<li>Discord WordLeader Bot [Defunt and Not Maintained] - A Discord Bot that maintained a leaderboard of wordle scores from server members and published it weekly. I was <i>particularly</i> proud of this one. Unfortunately not only is this bot currently unmaintained and most probably defunct (like the one above) but I have also lost its code (and of <i>soo</i> many projects) to an unfortunate antivirus accident :(</li>
			<li>Afterschool [Defunt and Not Maintained (see a pattern?)] - My <i>Magnus Opus</i> before CLC. One of the first <i>major</i> projects I remember undertaking in late-2019-early-2020 iirc. It used Angular and was meant to be a intra-school homework help site. You earned points and those points could be redeemed in school fêtes and such (my eyes were set on free food and games at my school's fête, which was the region's largest). The website was 99% done, when I got busy in studies and sidelined it, only for it to vanish later. Just like many of the "projects" on this list, this project is not only unmaintained, but also its code is gone forever.</li>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/hermitish/DIYLinks">DIYLinks - [Defunct and Not Maintained (oh boy)]</a> - <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a> like site, but only for (mostly tech) projects, tutorials etc.</li>
			<li>Did some DOS graphics programming (tried and failed 3D). The two circular logos you see across the site are a result of those endeavours. Also made some DOS tracker music on Adlib Tracker(one such song lives on as my ringtone) ;)</li>
			<li>Some very useful bash scripts that did all sorts of things - My favourite one was a python + bash project that showed a quote of the day, weather info, tech and economic news(I was a pretentious teen(am still)), space image of the day (from NASA, I believe?), random wikipedia articles(one of a random country because I love countries and the Atlas, and the other just any random article), and perhaps a few other things. Might still have them on my old github, will upload link once I find them.</li>
			<li>A <b>Myriad</b> of other shelved, abandoned and even missing projects that have/may never see the light of day.</li>
			<i>PS: Of the authenticity of the mention of dead and missing projects, I have been able to gather some (although slightly questionable) evidence in old github emails and email exchanges with a friend(my only social media were email and irc(yes I was <b>that</b> kind of a pretentious youth ;))</i>
